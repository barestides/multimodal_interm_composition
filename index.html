      <h2>Effectively Communicating And Resolving Disputes</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Communicating in an online environment can be difficult at times. Not being able to physically see or
      hear the other members of a conversation means one has to be more careful when sending messages via text.
      Discord provides Arcane with voice chat functionality, which can help alleviate the majority of these issues.
      Whenever possible, if you have a dispute with someone, you should take it to voice chat and talk it out,
      rather than smash you keyboard hoping your words reach the other person in the way you intended.</p>
